=====================Reader's Thoughts ================ :) 

// Feel free to leave this section :) just random thoughts lol

This is just my thoughts after writing such a extensive text phew. I am glad i completed the notes especially after leaving them in middle for so much time. It was exciting in start to having my notes written in Markdown around midway it was tiring especially understanding blurred text in Graphs portion :o. But towards the end book pretty much sums up everything and you have this enlightened and elevating feeling (may be cause i completed it) . Any way good think i got my speed from 30wpm to 70 wpm just by typing all the Text and code. Wished Typora offered vim mode :(.

Anyway Thx for reading and contribute if you like the project.

================== Contribution====================

- Correct Wrong Spellings ( please pardon my grammar sometimes its intentional sometimes i got lazy at typing).
- Correct and Check Implementation of code template I wrote ( ohh boy i wished i had time to do this with each and every code)
- Correct Facts or Definition ( To be honest sometimes i fell asleep writing these )
- Creating a c++ library for interface ( To Do for me :)
- Adding some good and important question (links) off the internet to make these notes valuable

=====================TLDR=======================

This Repo Basically contains the short notes on the books by Robert Sedgewick and Steven and Felix Halim.
This repo contains all the implementations in C++.

Written in Typora for Revision Purpose with all the code templates in c++.

I was hoping to write that made with love thingy but meh I would say made with all my might and time :), laziness and hope to learn something :) Woah do i make too many smileys i probably play too much minetest :).

##### Answer-5

Judiciary is the land of last resort. Judiciary always indulges itself when the illumination of Indian constitution is under trouble of losing its shine. Constitution stands at top while everything done by state diverges from there and can be tested by Judiciary.

 A policy made by the government is not liable to interference unless the court is satisfied that the rule-making authority has acted promptly or its not in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 and 16.

There are some very important challenges to policies which laid the foundation of current power of judiciary in policy making. For eg. Narmada Bachao Andlolan v Union of India, there was an issue regarding establishment of large dam and it was held by the majority that lead to change that courts in exercise of their jurisdiction wont enter into field of policy decision.
